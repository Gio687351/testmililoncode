Design Patterns
===============

Implement examples of all Design Patterns listed at [www.oodesign.com](http://www.oodesign.com).

### Reward

* Improve `Object-Oriented Programming` skill level.
* Achieve `Gang of One` achievement.

### Progress

* [x] [Abstract Factory](${design.patterns.package}/creational/abstract_factory)
* [x] [Builder](${design.patterns.package}/creational/builder)
* [x] [Prototype](${design.patterns.package}/creational/prototype)
* [x] [Object Pool](${design.patterns.package}/creational/prototype)
    
##### Behavioral Patterns

* [ ] Interpreter
* [ ] Iterator
* [ ] Mediator
* [ ] Memento
* [ ] Observer
* [ ] Strategy
* [ ] Template Method
* [ ] Visitor
* [ ] Null Object
    
##### Structural Patterns

* [x] [Adapter](${design.patterns.package}/structural/adapter)

Onion Architecture
==================

Implement in Java examples from [Modern Functional Programming: Part 2](http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp-part-2) article by [John A De Goes](https://twitter.com/jdegoes).

### Reward

* Improve `Functional Programming` skill level.
* Achieve `Functional Freedom` by implementing `Free` monad in Java.
